==================

The last time I made a personal website was around 2004, when I was freelancing. I built it using Dreamweaver (in code view!) and it was probably all kinds of awful, but it was the best I knew at the time. 

Before that I made one other personal website that I was really proud of. I built it using Dreamweaver (in visual mode), and it was for an art assignment. It was weird and impractical. It featured an image of my hair that I created with a scanner.

In community college I took a class and got some sort of certificate in using Microsoft FrontPage, but there was no place on campus more inspiring than th computer lab in the library.

I've been dissuaded from studying computer science because of my aversion to math and numbers. I like to think that I'm capable of overcoming that with enough time and practice, but when it came time to choose my college major, I went with the advice of a University-administered aptitude test and research my dad had done on up-and-coming careers. I studied Media Arts, doing plenty of film history and criticism but not enough production to gain real skill in shooting, editing, or direction. This has given me an appreciation for stories and those who create them.

I have fond memories of using computers when I was young. When my dad brought home an Apple II, I played Word Munchers on it all the time. One time we got this "portable computer" with a tiny green-and-black screen (and _two_ floppy drives!) I wrote stories on it and printed them on the noisy dot-matrix printer. When I got a hand-me-down Compaq in my room with dial-up internet, I would spend hours reading things that other people had written. I was mostly interested in those personal topics that get written on social media today. I made friends through social games and had some buddies on AIM to chat with. I explored webrings because it seemed like the best way to find more sites about the same topic. It never occurred to me that I could do anything but use and read the things that other people had made.

It took getting a job working in web design to convince me that I am capable of building things with computers. It has been many years, but I am building a personal site again.
