These are some random things I found on a paper list somewhere.

* Hey, my first Drupalcon!
* Reviewing and process: how I'm approaching my site
* Views, view modes, and fields: visually diagram a Drupal site structure
* Curriculum?
* Accessibility tools and testing process
* Testing with voiceover?

Some days I think I have all kinds of things to say. Other days I wonder whether I'm qualified to say anything at all. This is the Internet - I'm probably right in the middle.
